# Two-Plane crosssection
A line exists as a crosssection of two planes p<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>1</sub> if the planes are not parallel.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{matrix}
(\bold{P} - \bold{P}_0)\cdot\bold{N}_0 && = && 0\text{,} \\
(\bold{P} - \bold{P}_1)\cdot\bold{N}_1 && = && 0\text{,} \\
\end{matrix}\end{equation}$$
where
$$\begin{equation}
\bold{P} = \bold{P}_2 + A(\bold{N}_0\times\bold{N}_1)\text{.}
\end{equation}$$
The direction of the line is determined by the cross-product of the normal vectors of the planes.  
$\bold{P}_2$ is unknown right now.
By the way, we can assume the third plane which is paralle to neither p<sub>0</sub> nor p<sub>1</sub>
with the reference point $\bold{P}_0$ and the normal vector $\bold{N}_0\times\bold{N}_1$.
The plane is represented by
$$\begin{equation}
(\bold{P}-\bold{P}_0)\cdot(\bold{N}_0\times\bold{N}_1) = 0
\end{equation}$$
The crosssection point of the three planes can be derived from (1) and (3).
Substituting the point to $\bold{P}_2$ in (2), the crosssection line is determined.
