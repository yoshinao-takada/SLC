# Conceptual 3D Geometrical Structure
There are many concept in 3D geometry but only several concepts are defined here.

Table 1. Geometrical Concepts
Name | Description
-----|------------
Line | Linear line
Plane | Plane

## Line
A line is represented by a point $\bold{P}_0$ and a direction vector $\bold{D}$ ($|\bold{D}| = 1$).  
An arbitrary point 
$\bold{P}$ in the line and an arbitrary number $A$ have a relationship,
$$\begin{equation}
\bold{P} = \bold{P}_0 + A\bold{D}\text{.}
\end{equation}$$

## Plane
A plane is represented by a point $\bold{P}_0$ and a normal vector $\bold{N}$ ($|\bold{N}| = 1$).  
An arbitrary point $\bold{P}$ in the plane satisfies
$$\begin{equation}
(\bold{P} - \bold{P}_0)\cdot\bold{N} = 0.
\end{equation}$$
